USER STORY
 Woat is a sneaker inventory app where users can track their sneaker inventory as well as see how much their inventory is worth on the open market

 For my project I focused on the inventory aspect of GOAT App, which includes adding, editing and deleting sneakers to their inventories as well as seeing the value of a shoe ont the open market


User will Sign up with email address and password, which will both be required 
If user does not have an account already they will be redirected to the register page, where they will have to register first before logging in


Home page will show ---
    - Nav bar with Inventory
    - top 10 most popular shoes on Goat app
    - carousel with users inventory
    - top 5 most valuable shoes in users inventory

Inventory Page 
    - Will have sneakers displayed in cards that when hovered over will dispay the size and name of shoe
    - all cards, when clicked, will lead to a show page

Show page
    - will have all the same information but will allow user to edit said inventory or delete inventory all together
Add inventory will also be an option for full CRUD

Value page(if possible) will be a link on the show page that will lead you to this page
    -value page will show the the value of the current selected inventory, based on the purchase price vs the resell value on Goat(not sure yet how to bring in that data, or if i have to just hard code it)
